Streamledge Browser Extension

This is very basic web browser extension for chromium based web browsers that currently allows you
to right click YouTube, Twitch, and Kick links to either open in Streamledge or open in a new tab.

You will need to enable developer mode in your browser and load unpacked extension.

The streamledge server must be active for the extension to function, obviously.

For fine tuning the arguments used when Stremledge is launched from your browser, you may
carefully edit the url links in background.js. To know what url args to use, simply launch
Streamledge from the command prompt with --url-only and notice URL arguments that are used.
